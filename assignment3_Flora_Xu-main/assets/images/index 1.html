            [Identity Anxiety] from Milan Kundera <em>Identity </em> 'What is real? What is dream? Where is the division?'</h2>

                <p>
                    In Milan Kundera’s short novel “Identity” (1998), the intricate process of identity formation is unraveled through the lens of characters' imaginative projections. As a Czech-French novelist, he used to be revoked the Czechoslovak citizenship and exiled in France and self-identity recognition becomes an important theme in his works. The core inquiry revolves around the questions: How do I perceive myself? How do I interpret others' perceptions of me? Within this exploration, the individual separates from the primary subject “I” and becomes “the Other”. Here, the individual acts as “the Other” and observes the behavior of their identity with narcissism and self-pity.

                        Viewing today’s situation, internet connects people together and brings diverse culture environments. Individuals are eager to recognize their self-identities to find their position in the world. With the emphasis of individual’s ability and potential, individualism is emphasized, small personal feeling and imagination are exaggerated. The exploration of ‘Identity’ provides a new insight of self-identity perception corresponding to today’s world.

                            <li>
                                Drawing from Adriana Cavarero (2000) and Judith Butler (2001), it can be posited that the exposure and recognition by others are limited, superficial, and sometimes even deceptive. Therefore, the exploration of 'Identity' presents it as a grand subjective imagination — an intracranial carnival, without recognition by others.
                            </li>
                            <li>
                                Hegel (1977) advances a similar concept in the 'Phenomenology of Spirit’ with the notion of “I am the Other”. However, this represents an objective truth, emphasizing the mirrored alignment between “I” and “the Other,” rather than a subjective imagination in “Identity” that is embodied by Jean-Marc’s imagination of the great sorrow of losing his lover to his affectionateness. 
                            </li>

                             <li>
                              Moreover, by examining an episode where Chantal, the novel's protagonist, imagines herself as a Cardinal, the argument emerges that self-identity can be discerned in the present moment. This notion aligns yet further refines Hegel’s (1977) stance that identity is retrospective.
