        <textarea placeholder="Chantal's Thoughts (In Milan Kundera's Identity):
        Chantal grapples with the idea of visibility and invisibility in a relationship and society. She often feels that as she grows older, she becomes increasingly invisible to those around her, especially to other men. This fear of invisibility is juxtaposed with her younger days when she felt seen and desired. Her increasing sense of invisibility triggers feelings of doubt about Jean-Marc's love and sincerity. Chantal's musings and fears are emblematic of the anxieties we all face about aging, about being forgotten, and about the authenticity of love when the glow of youth fades. Additionally, her thoughts echo the broader societal tendency to render older women invisible, further emphasizing her internal conflict about her own identity."></textarea>
        <textarea placeholder="Jean-Marc's Thoughts (In Milan Kundera's Identity):
        Jean-Marc, on the other hand, constantly seeks to reassure Chantal of his genuine love for her. Yet he battles with the idea of identity in a different way, feeling that he can't always be the Jean-Marc that Chantal wants or sees. He grapples with the fluidity of identity, pondering over the question of who he really is and how he's perceived by his beloved. In moments of introspection, he wonders if our identities are, in part, constructed by how our loved ones see us, and if so, whether he's living up to the Jean-Marc that exists in Chantal's mind. His thoughts underscore the existential dilemma of whether we ever truly know ourselves or if our identities are in perpetual flux, shaped by external perceptions and our own internal dialogues."></textarea>
